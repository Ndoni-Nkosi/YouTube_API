## Data Structure Overview

The data was collected with the use of a YouTube API in a python script. It extracts one table with the following columns, video_id, channelTitle, title, publish date, viewCount, likeCount, commentCount, and duration. The table consists of over 3000 rows.</br>

## Executive Summary

Glory's channel was established in 2017, her channel only peaked in the year 2020. Her number of views have been dropping since 2021. 

## Insights Deep Dive

- quantified value
- business metric
- simple story about historical trend</br>
An overview of the data is that Glory's channel was created in 2017. Since then there have been over 3K video uploads, over 355k subscribers and over 116 million views. There has been a lot of egagemnt on her videos where there has been more that 4 million likes and 893k comments.</br>
According to the graph on the top left corner we see that the Other category has more video uploads amounting to 691. The other category is made up of shows that are not BB related. The least number of uploads is in the BBM seasons. This could be because there is a language barrier as BB housemates tend to to speak vernacular, which are languages that Glory does not understand as she is Nigerian. This makes ikt difficult for her to review the BBM seasons. A summarized snapshot of BBM seasons vs views has been shown below and we see that the numbers of views are decreasing since BBM returned where BBM Season was a hit vs the other seasons (Give a recommendation as this should improve in future).</br>
The graph on the top right shows us that since channel craetion date the channel peaked in the year 2020, during the reviews for BBN Season 5. The peak in views was due to Covid as a lot of people had to be indoors, so a lot of us watched a lot of television. The highest number of views was in BBN Season 6 in the year 2021. There is an occurrence of views peaking during the BBN seasons, especially for the uoploads in August. The channle did well during BBN season reviews (July-October). We notice a peak in views in a non-BBN season in 2022 (Jan-April), which is where BBM was back on people's screens with BBM Season 3. In 2023 January ther was a peak again where there was BB Titans, where there were Nigerain and South African contestants (Jan-April)</br>

Conclusion:
- It looks like Glory's subscribers and non-subscribers seem to enjoy and engage more on BBN seasons compared to BBM seasons. BBN seasons have more views that BBM. All BBM seasons didn't perform well, but only when BB Titans was introduced then views increased, which could prove that the Nigerian audience is greater than the South African audience on Glory's channel.
- or just simply that the audience prefers BB shows where there are Nigerain contestants
